#### Purpose

This is Bookchain, it is a decentralized virtual library to keep track of your physical library. Library? Yes, we do mean books.
This app consists of two components, this is the back-end portion. The front-end
is written in React, and is located here [Bookchain-react](https://github.com/Sh1pley/bookchain-react). This repository is written in Solidity and is built upon the block chain.

#### Getting Started

1.  This project is built in Solidity, want more info? See the resources section
    below.
2.  git clone or fork this repository `$ git clone https://github.com/njgheorghita/bookchain.git`
3.  Install Solidity `$ npm install -g solc`
4.  Install Truffle `$ npm install -g truffle`
5.  Install Testrpc `$ npm install ethereumjs-testrpc`

#### Running

1.  In a separate terminal session run `$ testrpc`
2.  Run `$ truffle migrate` this will migrate the contracts

#### Testing

1.  In a separate terminal session run `$ testrpc`

_Running the command `testrpc`, runs the localhost blockchain on port 8545_

2.  Run `$ truffle test` this command will run the test suite.

_You can also run `truffle test test/<filename>` to run a single test file
instead of the entire suite_
